My name is Vismay Gehlot and my github user is Vgehlot1999.

In the most recent commit, the owner made their initial commit where they added their hw1 RMD and html file ot the repository. The commit ID for this was faa2270.

I was unable to knit my partner's Rmd file because I do not have the .jpg file that they used in their page.

One difficulty that I encountered was that someone had logged into their github on my laptop previously to do their homework, so my initial commits came under their name. Because of this, I had to delete the files, folders, and the repository and do it again from scratch under my username so as to not cause a fatal error.
